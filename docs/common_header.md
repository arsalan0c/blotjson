* objects and arrays can be collapsed for simpler exploration
* supports dark mode

## Why *blotjson*?
* An external application is not required. There is no need to copy/paste or export your data
* An arbitrary number of JSON data can be visualised simply
* Security. Everything is done locally on your own computer.
